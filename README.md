scRNAseq analysis of Sagner et al. 2020

For analysis of the temporal TFs in the fore-, mid- and hindbrain, please download the dev_all.loom file (app. 19 GB) from Manno et al. 2020 from http://mousebrain.org/downloads.html

For analysis of the temporal TFs in the retina, please download 10X scRNAseq data of the developing retina (count matrix, cellular phenotype data and feature data) from https://github.com/gofflab/developing_mouse_retina_scRNASeq (Clark et al. 2019). 

All downloaded files must be placed into the 'input' folder.
